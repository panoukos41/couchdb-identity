[CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) identity store provider for the [ASP.NET Core Identity](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/Identity) using [CouchDB.NET](https://github.com/matteobortolazzo/couchdb-net).

The UserStore implements the following Interfaces:
- IQueryableUserStore
- IUserStore
- IUserPasswordStore
- IUserSecurityStampStore
- IUserEmailStore
- IUserPhoneNumberStore
- IUserRoleStore
- IUserLoginStore
- IUserTwoFactorStore
- IUserLockoutStore

The RoleStore implements the following Interfaces:
- IQueryableRoleStore
- IRoleStore

The project was insipired from the existing [AspNetCore.Identity.Cassandra](https://github.com/lkubis/AspNetCore.Identity.Cassandra) implementation.

# Before Getting started
This project was made in a hurry and was live tested on a really simple application so some things might not work as expected. Feel free to open an issue and even a pull request.

I will try my best to support the project and provide tests and samples whenever i find time.

Thanks for looking at this library ðŸ˜„

# Getting Started

By default a database named `identity` is used but you can change it using the options overload.

Your [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) database must include the following [design documents](ddocs/).

At your `Startup.cs` add your `ICouchClient` in DI and use the following code.
```csharp
using AspNetCore.Identity.CouchDB.Models;

// Configure Identity stores and services.
services.AddIdentity<CouchDbUser, CouchDbRole>()
        .AddCouchDbStores();
```

Or you can provide your own instance of `ICouchClient` in the options.
```csharp
// Configure Identity stores and services.
// With custom client.
services.AddIdentity<CouchDbUser, CouchDbRole>()
        .AddCouchDbStores(options => options
            .UseClient(new CouchClient("http://localhost:5984")));
```

Services are *registered as Singleton* since `ICouchClient` is/should be registered as such and no other dependency is needed.
